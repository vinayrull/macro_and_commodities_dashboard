# Macro and Commodities Dashboard

## Overview

This project uses Python to automatically collect macroeconomic and commodity market data from public APIs and visualize the results in an Power BI dashboard.
The Python script retrieves data from Alpha Vantage, processes and cleans the data, and saves it as CSV files. These CSV files are then imported into Power BI 
to create a dashboard that tracks economic indicators, commodity trends, and year-over-year performance.
